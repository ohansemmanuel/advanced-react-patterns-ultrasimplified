## What do you mean by 'Ultrasimplified'?

### 1. Real World Demos 🚀

You won't find basic hello world demos here. The demos have been intentionally designed to be actually helpful and **relatable**.

### 2. Mimics your day-to-day job as a developer 🖥

Each pattern is implemented and discussed via **a pull request**. **View** the PRs. **Read** the descriptions. Read the **comments**. Like you do at work!

### But I'm just a beginner. Isn't this too advanced?

Every implementation is well explained with comments, diagrams and notes. You've got this.
